"There For Me (Interlude)"



I know you're holding some tears
They haunt your new memories
Don't waste your life 'cause time is great
I'm over years and years
I'm feeling empathy
I know you do 'cause I'm afraid

I been feeling off
Been feeling off
I been feeling off
I'm a waste, I'm a waste, yeah

When I wake up
Feelin like I mean something
Shit you made up
I just signed a lease, homie
Got me shaped up
Shit been real easy for me
I'ma break up
Maybe you could be there for me, yeah
Maybe you could be there for me, yeah
Maybe you could be there for me, yeah
Maybe you could be
Maybe you could be there for me, yeah
Be there for me, yeah
