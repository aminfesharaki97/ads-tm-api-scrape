Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Hearing Your Voice"



Met a shaman, he was crazy
Called me stupid, stole my money
Told him 'bout what we've been facing
I've been jealous, often dating
Know you stole my fuckin' phone
Probably read something real crazy
Heard you changed your name in lovers
Wish that I could call you baby

But that's not fair
You got everything I need
Used to call me constantly
You cut your hair
Change it all except for me
Don't take back what's meant to be

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice

Wish you lived a little closer
Clean your house, borrow some clothes
Maybe talk 'bout California
Heard it's not like Indiana
I got time, what you expected?
Sleepless nights, felt disconnected
Smoke a lot, your dad don't care
He's on the porch catching some air

But that's not fair
You got everything I need
Used to call me constantly
You cut your hair
Change it all except for me
Don't take back what's meant to be

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice

Don't close your eyes again
Cause you're not there
I'm not confiding in
What's really here
What's really here

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
