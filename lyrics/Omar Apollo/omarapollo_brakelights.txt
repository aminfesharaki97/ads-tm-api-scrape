Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Brakelights"



My car is a little like you
It's not working right now
Say that we're lovers
And we miss our mothers again
She don't really like you
Boy I kind of like you
You don't really like to mention that to me
Tell em write a haiku cuz
No one really likes me
I'm getting used to that

Days by, baby I don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when I go fast
Why would you want me
Days by, baby I don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when I go fast
Why would you want me

Days by, I'm losing the sunrise
I'll fall close to you
Losing my mind
