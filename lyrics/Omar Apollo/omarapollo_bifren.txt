Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Bi Fren"



Lil' bitch still ain't paid me
I be out, you dig?
No boys allowed, sleep on the couch
Opal my mouth, you dig?
Smokin' on loud, stay in the town
Don't got allowances
Yeah, we allowing this
We some dirty kids
Naj said, "Get your money" (Your money)
Shit too sweet, not funny (Funny)
Back when we were bummy (Bummy)
Still had swag on hunnid (Hunnid)
You can't take none from me (Yeah)
You know we still runnin' (Uh-uh)
You ain't do no wrong (Wrong)
Can't keep up that's hunnid (Hunnid)

Uh, yeah
You is not important (Uh, yeah)
You a memory
Tryna get the green (Ayy, yeah, yeah)
You a lame, you know it (Uh, ayy)
Drive around the block
No matter what it cost

I still like him, I still like him
I used to drive around your block without no license
Separate you and your bitch, I'm not no hyphen
I hate your bitch, so I dipped out and jumped the high fence
He talking 'bout hi friend, I'm talkin' 'bout bi friend
I'm not gon' sit here like I owe you, ain't no mic here
You buzz so quick, then I dip out, that shit like light years
You irresistible, that's why I spend my time here

Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
You is not important (Uh, yeah, skrrt)
You a memory (Yeah, yeah)
Tryna get the green (Ayy, yeah, yeah)
You a lame, you know it (Uh, ayy)
Drive around the block
No matter what it cost

I wanna see you all night but I know you don't care
Not in love but I'll be right here
When I pull up on you and your girl
I'm still here, I'm still here
No, I'm kidding, not my business, I'm addicted
I don't feel it, she like, "Fuck"
I'm like, "Yuh", tell me that I'll go to jail
Oh, boy, you should go to Hell
Don't go callin' for my help
I see you runnin' laps around my phone, you can tell, uh

Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
You is not important (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You a memory (Yeah, yeah)
Tryna get the green (Ayy, yeah, yeah)
You a lame, you know it (Uh, yeah, yeah)
Drive around the block (Yeah, yeah)
No matter what it cost (Yeah, yeah)

Woo, woo, woo
