"Kickback"



I've been away but now I feel you, yeah
Wonder what made you feel like I could be the one, oh

Lately it's been me
I've pissed you off, ah
Let you in my feelings
You really feel, yeah
Ah-ah, sayin'

You been high, I get that
I been at the kickback
Nothing will content me
Doesn't matter, eh-eh
Thought you came from nothing
Jdawg that's my cousin
You should like my brother
Doesn't matter, ah-ah

I've had a taste of how you feeling, yeah
Yeah I've been hiding how I feel for way too long, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Lately it's been me
I've pissed you off, ah
Let you in my feelings
You really feel, yeah
Ah-ah, sayin'

You been high, I get that
I been at the kickback
Nothing will content me
Doesn't matter, eh-eh
Thought you came from nothing
Jdawg that's my cousin
You should like my brother
Doesn't matter, ah-ah

You been high, I get that
I been at the kickback
Nothing will content me
Doesn't matter, eh-eh
Thought you came from nothing
Jdawg that's my cousin
You should like my brother
Doesn't matter, ah-ah
