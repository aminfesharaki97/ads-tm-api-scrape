"Kissyew"



You, you
I got your sunglasses today
I know I know, no I
You, you

Ease up baby, I'll watch you through the night
And if you're tired, i'll drive
Don't sleep, we'll crash
Don't leave you in the past now

I really really wanna kiss you
I really really wanna kiss you, baby [x2]

You say you wanna be in love
Well, baby I could be enough
Don't leave, [?], alright you could stay here
Don't leave, baby
Turn and run away

I think you're in love with me [x4]

I really really wanna kiss you
I really really wanna kiss you, baby [x2]
