Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Stereo (Intro)"



I need, I need you
I want, I want you

Three days my eye's turning blue
My head, my mind, it turns to you
Ella, ella me dijo
Tome este vino
Baila tanto, baila tan bien
Ella, ella me dijo
Tome este vino
Baila tanto, baila tan bien

I need, I need you
I want, I want you

Drank too much
I really hate myself
Two cars race down the hill
Swerve quick, loose steering wheel
Turn it off
My shit don't work at all
I'm close to help my fall
But please don't take away my soul
Soul
Soul

I need, I need you
I want, I want you
