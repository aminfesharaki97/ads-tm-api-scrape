Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Erase"



I don't mind, my head's in the sky
Thinkin' of you, oh, feelin' for you, oh oh
It's cold right now, I miss you for life
It's not going away, I thought I'd be okay, yeah

I still think about the time
The time I spent just tryna grow with you
Baby, I was out of line
But you weren't there, you weren't there

And oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head

I wish you weren't feeling so sad
I feel what you do, oh, I got that from you, oh oh
I shouldn't be so bothered by you
I'd probably be okay, if you just went away, yeah

I still think about the time
The time I spent just tryna grow with you
Baby, I was out of line
But you weren't there, you weren't there

Oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head

I've been, I've been so guilty baby
I'm thinking about myself and I
What you, what you gon' feel me lately
I feel like I'm going out my way for you

Oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head
