Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Endlessly Interlude"



Yourself to me, baby (Baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (Ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (Everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (Endlessly)

Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
