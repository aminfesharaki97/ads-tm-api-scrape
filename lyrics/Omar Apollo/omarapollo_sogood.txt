"So Good"



Know you got a thing to do instead
But it's running away (Away)
Hold you to my heart and to my chest
Got me hurting my brain (My brain)

Say it's obvious that I don't need your lovin', babe
(Baby, what'd you say?)
Why would I? Baby, what'd you say?
It's wrong and I need you, oh I

And I want you all
For a minute
When did you turn so sensitive?
And I want you all
Baby, please
Why would you go and turn it down?
Yeah, everything you want
Is everything I need
So why you walk away?
This love is like a dream
But baby, turn around
You had me from the start
I'm losing all control
So go and break my heart

So good
So good

Took a couple months to get upset
Been avoiding the pain (The pain)
Maybe I should go and catch my breath
I've been tryna explain (Explain)

Say it's obvious that I don't need your lovin', babe
(Baby, what'd you say?)
Why would I? Baby, what'd you say?
It's wrong and I need you, oh I

And I want you all
For a minute
When did you turn so sensitive?
And I want you all
Baby, please
Why would you go and turn it down?
Yeah, everything you want
Is everything I need
So why you walk away?
This love is like a dream
But baby, turn around
You had me from the start
I'm losing all control
So go and break my heart

So good
So good

Yeah, everything you want
Is everything I need
So why you walk away?
This love is like a dream
But baby, turn around
You had me from the start
I'm losing all control
So go and break my heart

So good
So good
So good
So good
So good
