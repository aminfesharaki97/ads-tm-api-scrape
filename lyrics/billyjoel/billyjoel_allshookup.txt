Billy Joel Lyrics




"All Shook Up"
(originally by Elvis Presley)
(from "Honeymoon In Vegas" soundtrack)



Well, bless my soul what's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' queer as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Uh huh, ohh, ya, ya, yeah

Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Now, who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Uh huh, ohh, hey, ya, yeah

Well, please don't ask what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Uh huh, ohh, ya, ya, yeah!

Well, my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shakin' like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this soul of mine
Is to have that girl that I love so fine

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Uh huh, ohh, ya, ya, yeah
Uh huh, oh ohh, ya, ya, yeah
Uh huh, ohh!, yeah, yeah!
I'm all shook up!
