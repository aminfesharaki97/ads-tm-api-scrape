Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Hey Boy"
(feat. Kali Uchis)



Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe)
Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe)
Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe)

I wonder how you really feel about me
I love those feelings that you bottled, you should pour 'em on me
Baby, I can't believe you had to live a life without me
Come here and show me how you feel, I wanna see if it's real

Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe, baby)
Hey, boy (Hey, boy)
Say, babe (Say, babe)

'Cause we don't talk much, but you never forget me
And when I ain't around, I'm still in your sex dreams
Always on your mind, you could call it haunting
Papi, ven pa'ca and see this ass in person

Chop, slop, hopscotch
Trade on me, wanna fuck
Roll me up a little runtz
Homie, you gon' hit me up?
