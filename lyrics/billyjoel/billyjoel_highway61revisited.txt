"Highway 61 Revisited"
(originally by Bob Dylan)



One, two, one two three four

Oh God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"
Abe says, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
God say, "No." Abe say, "What?"
God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run"
Well, Abe says, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
God says, "Out on Highway 61"

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go?
Howard said, "There's only one place I know"
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Ol' Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61

All right, my friendly baby

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
"I got 40 red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute son"
He said, "Yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61"
(Aw, breakdown!)

Now the fifth daughter on the twelth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white"
He said "come here and step into the light"
He says, "Hmm you're right"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
Aw but the 2nd mother was with the 7th son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
He was tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61"

Highway 61

Hey...All right...All right...

I've got blisters on my fingers!
