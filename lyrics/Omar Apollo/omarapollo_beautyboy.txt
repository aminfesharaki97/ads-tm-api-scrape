"Beauty Boy"



I don't know
Stone's too cold
You're always on my mind
I'm smoking though
I'm hoping so
You always hit my line

I need my job
To see my beauty boy
And if you leave
Oh it's not my choice

I want to say I love him
I want to say I love him

You take all my love
I'm afraid I can't love no one again (one again)
You're all I want
(Oooh)

See, boy I love it when you come
I don't care for me
I don't know how to waste my time
Because he's seventeen
You came again
I don't know you love me for it
You came again
Don't try to say "no more"

I want to say I love him
I want to say I love him

You take all my love
I'm afraid I can't love no one again
You're all I want
(Oooh)
