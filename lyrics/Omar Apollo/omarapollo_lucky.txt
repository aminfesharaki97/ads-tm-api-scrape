Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Lucky"



I'm not upset but don't carve my feels out
I'll lose you like a dime
Blue chest and blue face and blue head
I'm not pretending

You're lost again, you waste your time, I think I'll start all over
Don't wait to comfort me, I think I lose so don't pull over
You wish you had me blind and turned my mind you didn't help me
I changed for you but you don't really want me, I feel lucky

I feel lucky
Oh, I feel lucky
I feel lucky
Oh, I feel lucky

And as she hurts my head I wish you were alone
I'm mad if I'm your fool, I'll lose you in the morn'
It feels like you really want it all
It feels like you really want it all

You're lost again, you waste your time, I think I'll start all over
Don't wait to comfort me, I think I'll lose so don't pull over
You wish you had me blind and turned my mind you didn't help me
I changed for you but you don't really want me, I feel lucky

I feel lucky
Oh, I feel lucky
I feel lucky
Oh, I feel lucky
