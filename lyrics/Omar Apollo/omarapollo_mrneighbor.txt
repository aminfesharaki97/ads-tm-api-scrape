Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Mr. Neighbor"



Hello, Mr. Neighbor
I know you watch the rising sun like I do
Staring at God's acre
Pillows soft as leaves that pile in November

I wanna be alone
I, I don't want to be alone
So don't test me, don't test me
Don't test me

I'ma do you like you did me

Baby, ah yeah
Wylin', ah yeah
Watch me, ah yeah
Baby, ah yeah
Fuck me, ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
