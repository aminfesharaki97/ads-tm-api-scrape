Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Ignorin"



Love beating, it's coming, it might please you
Glove fitted, I'm walking with ease
Wasn't a compliment, was it too obvious?
That I need you, I need you

I don't think you dumb, you kinda hot
It's a lovely morning
Fuck, I love your colour, it's so fun
Oh, is that your colour?
Damn, they think I'm cool
I'm icy huh, slip your number, call it
What's your, uh, what's your, uh, what's your uh uh

I hear you callin'
I'm just ignorin' probably
Don't got your number
I ain't that caring baby

So addicted, wishing that you were mine
Then might have to lie, I do that all the time
I'm out here wishing, wishing for other guys
That I don't really like, what a waste of time

I don't think you dumb, you kinda hot
It's a lovely morning
Fuck, I love your colour, it's so fun
Oh, is that your colour?
Damn, they think I'm cool
I'm so icy huh, slip your number, call it
What's your, uh, what's your, uh, what's your uh uh

I threw it away
No need today

I hear you callin'
I'm just ignorin' probably
Don't got your number
I ain't the caring baby
