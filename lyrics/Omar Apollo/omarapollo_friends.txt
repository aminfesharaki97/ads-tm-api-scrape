Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Friends"



I know I thought that we could be friends
But now I'm caught up in this mess
I can't pretend that I don't feel this
'Cause if I don't it'll leave me depressed

And I know it don't make no sense
But I'm getting used to this
And I'm older now but I'm still young
And I got many, oh many years to come

You just thought I just wanted to be friends
You just thought I just wanted to be friends

And I never said it out loud
I'd end up looking like a fool
Am I the only one afraid to make a move
Maybe you're feeling what I'm feeling too

And I know it don't make no sense
But I'm getting used to this
And I'm older now but I'm still young
And I got many, oh many years to come

You just thought I just wanted to be friends
You just thought I just wanted to be friends

And I'm older now but I'm still young
And I got many, oh many years to come

You just thought I just wanted to be friends
You just thought I just wanted to be friends
You just thought I just wanted to be friends
You just thought I just wanted to be friends
