Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Petrified"



The bedspread was silk
But the marbles were stiff
He showed me my face
So I loosened my grip
A shadow came down
Told me I live, a lie

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking about all the words you say to me

A stranger convinced me to cancel my trip
He sang me a song but it didn't exist
He said an angel came down and gave him a melody

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking about all the words you say to me

I believe in making up
I believe in making up
I believe in what I fear
Lately I've been able to see more clear

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking bout all the words you say to me
