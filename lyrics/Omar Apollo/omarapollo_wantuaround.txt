Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Want U Around"
(feat. Ruel)



Baby, I want you around
Baby, I want you around

I'm done with you
And baby, I promise I'll be what you wanted
But now and here
Heart took some damage I wish I could vanish from you
You
You
You

And baby, I want you around (Baby, baby)
(I want you around) Baby, I want you around

I'm missing you
Took me for granted and that what you wanted
And I'll disappear
Told me you promise, I can't even stand it
You
I miss you, baby
You
You
(Miss you, miss you, miss you)

And baby, I want you around (Baby, baby)
(I want you around)
(I want you around) Baby, I want you around

Baby, I need you to notice me
See your name on my phone 'fore I go to sleep
Why you trying to push me away
What else are you tryna gain?

Say what you want about me
Say what you want about me

Baby, I want you around
Baby, I want you around
