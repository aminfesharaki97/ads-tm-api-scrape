"Evergreen (You Didn't Deserve Me At All)"



He don't love
Me no more
He don't love
He don't love
Me no more

Evergreen, he controls me
Was there something wrong with my body?
Am I not what you wanted, babe?
If I ever tried, if I ever tried
I would

Evergreen, he tears me to pieces
(Evergreen) Doesn't even have to try

She don't
Know you like me
She could never love you more
More than me
But sometimes I pray that you fall in love
I've cried, I've cried so much
For you, baby

Evergreen, he tears me to pieces
(Evergreen) Doesn't even have to try
(Evergreen)

You know you really made me hate myself
Had to stop before I break myself
Shoulda broke it off to date myself
You didn't deserve me at all
At all, at all

One last time
I see, (Ever) Evergreen
Please don't come home to me
Sweet Evergreen
He don't love
Me no more

He don't love
Me no more
He don't love
He don't love
Me no more
