Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Invincible"
(feat. Daniel Caesar)



If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me?
If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me?
(If I were to)

Twenty-four hours after CS:01 release
I miss my girl, it's time to hit the streets
I went to check my doc, get some vitamin C
You won't believe what happened to me, I

Drip, drip, drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it
And I woke up in an ambulance

If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me?
If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me?
(If I were to)

Sixty-four hours since my baby spoke to me
He kissed me, now I love his dopamine
I tried to go to sleep but my brain on 2C-B
You won't believe what happened to me, I
Drip, drip, drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it
I been gone, moving high speed now
That's my song, let me hear that bounce
Latin boy, Frida Khalo brow
Jacquemus jeans, Ferragamo brown
Venetian walls with porcelain tile
286, Donnie Darko town
If I'm down, would you help me out?
If I'm down, would you help me out?

I had to call you back to tell you that (Call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (Could have spared my feelings)
I'm not invincible, I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible)
I had to call you back to tell you that (Call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (Could have spared)
I'm not invincible
I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible)

If I were to go tell me would you notice me
If I were to go tell me would you notice me
If I were to go tell me would you notice me
