"Bad Life" lyrics

Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Bad Life"
(feat. Kali Uchis)



You give me nothing
But I still change it to something
And I'm still thinking how you touch me, yeah

That's a bad life
Bad life that you're living
Oh
That you're living
That's a bad life
Bad life that you're living
Oh
That you're living

I can be selfish
You laid your head on me heavy
But I can't help but think you lust me, yeah

That's a bad life
Bad life that you're living
Oh
That you're living
Be right next to you
Is it cool if I come through?
Ride me like a coupe

That's a bad life
Bad life that you're living
Oh
That you're living
Be right next to you
Is it cool if I come through?
Ride me like a coupe

'Cause I feel it deeper (Deeper), and stronger (Stronger)
It won't be much longer till you see for yourself
(Till you see for yourself)
That's a bad life you live
(That's a bad life you live)
Steal my pride
(Steal my pride)
Every time
(Every time)
Do you feel it all
(Do you feel it all)
Right, right now

Do you hear me?
I don't believe in any of that
Be right next to you
Is it cool if I come through?
Ride me like a coupe
