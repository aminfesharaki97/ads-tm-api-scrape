"Pretty Boy"



Pretty boy
Pretty like the ocean and the sky at night
And I fell in you
Right after we made love on a starry night
And the wind crept in through our window
I can feel it on my skin
You're so pretty boy (Pretty boy)
I think of you so much, I couldn't love you more (I couldn't love you more)
I just dream of you (Dream of you)
When you're not around I picture you next to me (Next to me)
And it hurts to think that someone else might love you like I do

Just know that I'm missing you
Stole my heart and made me run
You're so beautiful (Your skin so smooth)
You stole my heart and made me run to you
Baby, it's us

You're my favorite boy
Nobody's ever felt the things you feel from me
And if I let you go (Let you go)
Don't think that I could ever really be at peace (Ever be at peace)
'Cause the way you talk makes me undress
Think of times we can't relive

Just know that I'm missing you
Stole my heart and made me run
You're so beautiful (Your skin so smooth)
You stole my heart and made me run to you
Baby, it's us
