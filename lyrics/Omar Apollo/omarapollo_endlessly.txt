Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Endlessly"



Yourself to me, baby (Baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (Ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (Everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (Endlessly)

If you me need now
I would hold you tight, hold you tight
If you change your mind
Don't wait til the moments right, moments right

You ain't even touched me in so long
You ain't said you loved me in so long
You don't even try to call my phone
Did you even love me all along?
You ain't even touched me in so long
You ain't said you loved me in so long
You don't even try to call my phone
Did you even love me all along?

Yourself to me, baby (Baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (Ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (Everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (Endlessly)

'Cause if I decide to leave tonight
I'll have no pride
At least I could try to be by your side
But somethings not right

You ain't even touched me in so long
You ain't said you loved me in so long
You don't even try to call my phone
Did you even love me all along?
You ain't even touched me in so long
You ain't said you loved me in so long
You don't even try to call my phone
Did you even love me all along?

Yourself to me, baby (Baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (Ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (Everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (Endlessly)

UMI - "Down To Earth" Can't get no sleep
The moon, it knows I
Don't want you to leave
I think you're divine, I
Left the old me
Just to be with you, I try
To be free with you
I'd fall back down to earth
So what you want?...
Q - "You" You ain't give me a purpose
To better up myself so
Show me that you're worth it
Girl, you know it's the start of fall
Cuffing season is coming up
And I ain't tryna fall
Its been a couple years since...
Free Nationals - "Apartment" It was a long and sad goodbye
But now it's time to pick up the pieces
I have to leave my sisters couch today
Bittersweet and every time
But life just isn't perfect
Said it's a once in a lifetime,...
Orion Sun - "Antidote" I fell in love in the sky
On the back of a dragon
It was magic
We were so high, I thought I'd die
'Cause I could see heaven
It was heaven

But it was all a dream
I woke up in my bed
It's so damn hot...
Duckwrth - "Super Bounce" Super bounce
Gon' drop it
Fast fast
Baby super sonic
Get your gas mask
All them niggas tote is tropic
For this fast cash
Venmo me them economics

Super bounce
Gon' drop it
Fast fast
Baby super sonic...
