"Archetype"



There's a lot of boys in California
They don't get along like you and I
So pretty that you kill me softly
If you were to leave, if I were to die
You know I really want to risk it all
Kiss my collarbone, found my archetype

If you need me, I'll be right there waitin'
Hold me till I break thin, don't want this to end
(Don't want this to end)
Could you help me, help you think about me
I think of you daily, I could give you all
(I can give you all)

You're the only one that holds me
You're the only one that holds me

Yea, I know you're feeling paranoia
Are you in love? Cause I wanna try
I can tell just by the way that you're talking to me
You don't have a clue, neither do I
I didn't really think you cared at all
What you said on the phone left me petrified

If you need me, I'll be right there waitin'
Hold me till I break thin, don't want this to end
(Don't want this to end)
Could you help me, help you think about me
I think of you daily, I could give you all
(I can give you all)

You're the only one that holds me
You're the only one that holds me
You're the only one that holds me
You're the only one that holds me

There's a lot of boys in California
They don't get along like you and I

Hearing guitars like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me

Relax don't fight the wave, light the way...
