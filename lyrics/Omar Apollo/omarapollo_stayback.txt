Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Stayback"



I can't help that you been on my mind
I can't help that you been on my mind
See you around cause I don't care anymore
See you around cause I don't care anymore
It's not that bad took all that I had to forget about you baby
It's not that bad took all that I had to forget about you baby

You know I been feeling you since way back
But I couldn't even make the words to say that, say that
If I could switch bodies you know I'd change that, change that
But you could never love me so stayback, stayback

You know I been feeling you since way back
But I couldn't even make the words to say that, say that
If I could switch bodies you know I'd change that, change that
But you could never love me so stayback, stayback

I can't help that you been on my mind
I can't help that you been on my mind
