Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Pram"



Baby I know
That sometimes I'm bad at the usual
I really miss talkin' on the phone at night
Well there's a storm tonight
And you can call me

I don't smoke as much as you but
I rewrote this verse for you
'Cause I just want you to notice me
I just want you to notice me
I just want you to notice me
