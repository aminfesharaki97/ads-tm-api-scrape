"Waiting On You" lyrics

Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Waiting On You"



Handsome and tall, my baby
They think he gets all the ladies
If you were there then you would know
Don't even care nobody
Invites him to all the parties
If he cared then he would go

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

Buff and his skin looks gorgeous
How could someone ignore this?
We took a trip down a new road
After his pupils widened
It got him realizing
That he wouldn't dream to be alone

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

Voice in my head

I don't want to think...
