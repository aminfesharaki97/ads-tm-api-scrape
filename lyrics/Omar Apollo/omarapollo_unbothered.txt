Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Unbothered"



I don't need what you need
I'm so unbothered by you
I used to think you're the only thing bright like the moon

I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I've been avoiding you, sorry if you feel alone
I'm doing fine

I don't need what you need
I'm so unbothered by you
