Billy Joel Lyrics




"All You Wanna Do Is Dance"



Oh baby, you don't get turned on by the radio.
Oh baby, you got nothing to play on your stereo.
"Why don't the Beatles get back together?"
"Why don't nobody sing of romance?"-
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.

Oh baby, I think you are lost in the seventies.
Oh baby, "The music she ain't what she used to be."
You don't understand what they're saying,
You've given it every chance
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.

Well you wish you were back in the good old days,
When tomatoes were cheaper,
and you never heard the words of your favorite songs
Through a three inch speaker.
And you never messed around with dangerous drugs,
You were all getting sick on beer
And you didn't get any (unless you went steady and made out for a year).

Well you can hide away honey, in your rock and roll dreams,
You can stand by your blue suede shoes
But the party is over,
And I'm getting tired of waiting for you.

Oh baby, "Where are the oldies they used to play?"
Oh baby, you want to crawl back into yesterday,
You don't want to deal with the future,
You don't want to make any plans-
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.
