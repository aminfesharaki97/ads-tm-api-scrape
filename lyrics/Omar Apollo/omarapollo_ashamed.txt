"Ashamed"



Don't need you in my life
It's not that I don't love you, baby, huh
(It's not that I don't love you, baby)
Can't think of what you want
I wish that I could show you, baby

Hey, easy come and easy go and talk too much
Making me really wanna come through, huh (Yeah, baby)

I don't want to check, yeah
I just do my best, woo
Baddies to my left, huh
Goofy call the ref because I'm cooler than you

Are, are you ashamed?
What are we supposed to do with our hearts?
Love is not a game
I'm just here protecting all that I are

Don't need you in my life
It's not that I don't love you, baby, huh (Ow)
Can't think of what you want
I wish that I could show you, baby (Ow)

Ah, Motorola, can't control ya
Callin' home just to see if it's gonna go through, huh (Yeah, babe)

I don't want to check, yeah
I just do my best, woo
Baddies to my left, huh
Goofy call the ref because I'm cooler than you

Are, are you ashamed?
What are we supposed to do with our hearts?
Love is not a game
I'm just here protecting all that I are

I will give you want you want, let's finish what we started
Got me dancing in the dark, let's finish what we started
I can't get you off my mind (Mind)
And I will keep you satisfied (Satisfied)
Just look real deep into my eyes
Can't live without you by my side (Side)
I can't get you off my mind (Mind)
I will keep you satisfied (Satisfied)
Just look real deep into my eyes (Into my eyes)
Can't live without you by my side (You by my side)
