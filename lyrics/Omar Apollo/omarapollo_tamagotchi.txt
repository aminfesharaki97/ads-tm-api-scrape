Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Tamagotchi"



Quiere ese Louis Vuitton
Uh, no me deja en paz con ese cabrón, con ese cabrón
No por el otro, borracho los dos (Uh)
Si quieres conmigo, pierde ese control, ese control

Bitch, this Tamagotchi
Tour bus through Milwaukee
Bitch, I'm making bread (Bread)
Sound like Pavarotti
Bitch, my bag Céline (Céline)
You can't get it off me (Off me)
Bitch, this not my scene (Scene)
Vamos pa' Miami (Miami)

Feel on my waistline
I'm in LA, four hours away, just hit me on FaceTime (FaceTime)
Feeling so good, feeling so good, singing a bass line (Bass)
Your body is on me, you touching up on me, we cum at the same time (Same time)
At the same time

You with somebody, or are you cool?
I want your body, you want me too
I see you coming, I come for you
Need you around me, I know you do

Ando de gira y todos me siguen, los chicos me quieren tocar
Tengo dinero y ando soltero, dime lo que quiere' comprar
Aquí está muy frío, no' vamos, te sigo, ¿dónde quieres ir a volar? (Ayy)
Algo sencillo con un cigarrillo me dicen que quieren follar (Pop that, pop that)

Bitch, this Tamagotchi
Tour bus through Milwaukee
Bitch, I'm making bread (Bread)
Sound like Pavarotti
Bitch, my bag Céline (Céline)
You can't get it off me (Off me)
Bitch, this not my scene (Scene)
Vamos pa' Miami (Miami)

Feel on my waistline
I'm in LA, four hours away, just hit me on FaceTime (FaceTime)
Feeling so good, feeling so good, singing a bass line (Bass)
Your body is on me, you touching up on me, we cum at the same time (Same time)
At the same time

You with somebody, or are you cool?
I want your body, you want me too
I see you coming, I come for you
Need you around me, I know you do

This is what you want, I'm sure
I ain't tryna front, no more
Ain't seen you in months, or more
You're all that I want, for sure

This is what you want, I'm sure
I ain't tryna front, no more (Tired of being alone, tired of being alone)
Ain't seen you in months, or more
You're all that I want, for sure

Bitch, this Tamagotchi
Tour bus through Milwaukee
Bitch, I'm making bread (Bread)
Sound like Pavarotti
Bitch, my bag Céline (Céline)
You can't get it off me (Off me)
Bitch, this not my scene (Scene)
Vamos pa' Miami (Miami)

(Pop that, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pop that)
