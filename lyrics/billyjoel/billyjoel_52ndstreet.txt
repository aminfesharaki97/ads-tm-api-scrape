"52nd Street" lyrics

Billy Joel Lyrics




"52nd Street"



They say it takes a lot to keep a love alive
In every heart there pumps a different beat
But if we shift the rhythm into overdrive
Well, we could generate a lot of heat
On Fifty Second Street
Oh oh Fifty Second Street

We're gonna have a little show parade
Before they know the second bar was played
We're gonna slip it to 'em short and sweet on Fifty Second Street
