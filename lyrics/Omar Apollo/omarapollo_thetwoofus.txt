Omar Apollo Lyrics




"The Two Of Us"



Young and in love
Got someone I can trust
And I know that you can feel the two of us

Young and in love
Got someone I can trust
And I know that you can feel the two of us

Young and in love
Got someone I can trust
And I know that you can feel the two of us

Young and in love
Got someone I can trust
And I know that you can feel the two of us
