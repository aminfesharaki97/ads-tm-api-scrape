"Killing Me" lyrics

Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Killing Me"



You-ooh, ooh-ooh
You-ooh, ooh-ooh

Why, do I depend on you?
Sixteen, about to pull up
Think 'bout your body too much
I'm, feelin' you for real
Missin' the party for what?
There ain't nobody but us

Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
They wanna lie too
Just wanna slide through, oh

What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, shit killing me
That's right, shit killing me

Qu√© locura solo piense a ti
Cuando me tocas y me llamas, oh Lord
Adrenaline, gentleman right there
Skeletons that I don't hold back
Try to stop, do you feel relaxed?
Love you but you make feel light-headed, oh, oh

Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
They wanna lie too
Just wanna slide through, oh

What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, shit killing me (That's, right, that's right, that's right, that's, right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, shit killing me (That's, right, that's right, that's right, that's, right, that's right, that's right)

That's, right, that's right, that's right
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Ooh, ooh-woah)
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Oh, why I kissed you?)
