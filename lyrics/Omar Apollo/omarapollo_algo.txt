Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Algo"
(feat. Drayco McCoy)



I'm not so perfect, but I really try
That's enough affection coming for my life
Talk about it when it comes to users
I don't really like to chill with losers
I be running all the time

¿Por qué me amas tú?
¿Por qué me amas?
Yo no tengo la opción de volver pa' atrás
Yo no sabia que estabas conmigo
Nunca lo dijo, nunca lo dijo

Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Oh, something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind

Ooh baby, let me touch you right here
Yeah, you're perfect, you know I'm worthless
Shouldn't deserve this
But you're right here
You twerkin
Girl, your body language moving in cursive
Mami I know you probably just like me 'cause you don't know me
Shorty I know molly hit highly, I'm also rolling
When the moonlight shines, and the hearts get stolen
Let's fucking get high 'til the morning
Come on here

I'm not so perfect, but I really try
That's enough affection coming for my life
Talk about it when it comes to users
I don't really like to chill with losers
I be running all the time

¿Por qué me amas tú?
¿Por qué me amas?
Yo no tengo la opción de volver pa' atrás
Yo no sabia que estabas conmigo
Nunca lo dijo, nunca lo dijo

Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Oh, something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Oh, something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
