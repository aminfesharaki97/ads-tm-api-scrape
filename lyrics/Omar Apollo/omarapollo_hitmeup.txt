Omar Apollo, Dominic Fike & Kenny Beats Lyrics




"Hit Me Up"



Said, I've got some time I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up

Pretty boy, pretty boy
Not a city guy
I ain't intimate, I don't wanna fit
Fill you up, fill you up
Put your head down
By my headphones
I don't get it but
Pullin' up, pullin' up
In my car
All my friends
Coming down
Say you won't, say you won't
Ride with me, yeah

I've got some time, I'ma use it
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up

You know I wouldn't tell you where to go
Nobody listens to the radio, baby
We're bending corners like we're running from the sun
The whip is turning different colors and you takin' on changes

Wish I could see you, come around and fill you up
Waited for you, baby, but you stood me up
Breaking what you gave me, wasn't good enough
What you gave me wasn't good enough

Wish I could see you come around
Like one more time
Faded like dumb it down
Over quick just like summer time
Baby, just double down
I bet you would fuck with me now

Said, I've got some time I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up
