Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Stayback (Remix)"
(feat. Bootsy Collins)



I got a lot on my mind, especially you
I can't help that you been on my mind
And I'm thinking about you, all the time
Yeah, I can't help that you been on my mind
You know I see you around
See you around 'cause I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore, yeah
See you around 'cause I don't care anymore
But I'd just like to say, that uh
It's not that bad
You took all that I had to forget about you, baby
It's not that bad
You took all that I had to forget about you baby

Oh, but you know I still feel you
You know I been feeling you since way back
But I couldn't even make the words to say that, say that
If I could switch bodies you know I'd change that, change that
But you could never love me (But you could never love me)
So stay back, stay back

Well, uh, I just wanna lay with my baby, yeah
But this is how we do it
There really ain't nothing to it
But this is how we do it

You know I been feeling you since way back
Stay back, stay back
But I couldn't even make the words to say that, say that
I'ma get that, I'ma get that, girl
If I could switch bodies you know I'd change that, change that
But you could never love me
But you could never love me so stay back, stay back

Yeah, little miss muffin
Girl, I like your stuffing
I can't help that you been on my mind
Yeah, I admitted to mucha
Mucha, gucha, gucha
I can't help that you been on my mind
I've been horny for days
Girl, you shouldn't play with me
I can't help that you been on my mind
And whatever you say, I still miss you every day
I can't help that you been on my mind
Yeah, mind, mind, mind
Tell 'em what we talking 'bout Omar
