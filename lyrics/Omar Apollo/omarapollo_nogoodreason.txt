Omar Apollo Lyrics




"No Good Reason"



I heard you talk about me boy how come you don't admit it
I know you said I love you but I really wanna hear it
You act like if you said it that I'd hate you but I'm with it
Just tell me what you want 'cause you know I'd be down to give it

What you making me mad for? (What you making me mad for?)
Why you talking like that for? (Why you talking like that for?)
Who you tryna be bad for? (Who you tryna be bad for?)
What you making me mad for?

Fuck you talkin' 'bout I don't know, say, "I don't know"
Fuck you talkin' 'bout I don't know, say, "I don't know"
Fuck you talkin' 'bout I don't know, say, "I don't know"
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, yeah, fuck you talkin' 'bout, I don't know

I call you all the time you picking up just introduce it
You say you wanna talk, I bring it up, you acting clueless
What do I gotta do to change your mind, how can I prove it?
You love to waste my time
But this your life I just improve it

What you making me mad for? (What you making me mad for?)
Why you talking like that for? (Why you talking like that for?)
Who you tryna be bad for? (Who you tryna be bad for?)
What you making me mad for?

What you making me mad for? (What you making me mad for?)
Why you talking like that for? (Why you talking like that for?)
Who you tryna be bad for? (Who you tryna be bad for?)
What you making me mad for?

Fuck you talkin' 'bout I don't know, say, "I don't know"
Fuck you talkin' 'bout I don't know, say, "I don't know"
Fuck you talkin' 'bout I don't know, say, "I don't know"
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, yeah, fuck you talkin' 'bout, I don't know

WILLOW - "Wait A Minute!" Wait a minute
I think I left my conscience on your front doorstep, oh oh
Wait a minute
I think I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
But I'm here right now, right now

Kali Uchis - "telepatía" Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

Alina Baraz - "Off The Grid" You say you're loving the way I
Show you the stars in the daylight
You do the same for me every day
You say you're loving the way we
Don't gotta say what we're thinking
Never no pressure to fill up...
Daniel Caesar - "Japanese Denim" I don't stand in line, I don't pay for clubs, fuck that

You're my four leaf clover

Hope she don't fade away
