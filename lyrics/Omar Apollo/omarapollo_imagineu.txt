Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Imagine U"



Sometimes you touch me on my face
I wish you could've never left me
You're picking up my phone, on 2%
But you're not too far from me

And sometimes when you're walking by
I'll tell you I want you, I'll call you, I'll call you
And sometimes when you're walking by
I'll tell you I want you, I'll call you

Imagine you
Imagine you
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Imagine you
Imagine you
Say that you love me
Say that you love me

I miss you feeling on my waist
You never told me I was rushing
But my mind's changing every day
I'm glad that you could even trust me

And sometimes when you're walking by
I'll tell you I want you, I'll call you, I'll call you
And sometimes when you're walking by
I'll tell you I want you, I'll call you

Imagine you
Imagine you
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Imagine you
Imagine you
Say that you love me
Say that you love me

I need to tell you something
I think I'll call you again
I hate when you hang with him
I think we're better as friends
I need to tell you something
I think I'll call you again
I hate when you hang with him
I think we're better as friends

Imagine you
Imagine you
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Imagine you
Imagine you
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
