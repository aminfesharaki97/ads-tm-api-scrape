Billy Joel Lyrics




"Cross To Bear"



Well, I know you got your troubles
But I've got problems of my own
It's all relative you see, what happiness should be
And we got to work it out alone

I know about your situation
And I know all about your pain
But you know it's true though it's no comfort to you
Into each life must fall some rain

We all have our cross to bear
We all walk in darkness sometimes
Though I know it don't seem fair
We all have our cross to bear

You know I hate to see you cry
I hate to see you cry now
Because I had my share of tears
And though it may sound cool, you know I'd be a fool
To let it slide a few more years

Listen, I just got to have my freedom
And if that's giving you the blues
That's the price you pay, Lord, there ain't no other way
But to get down on your knees and pay your dues
'Cause don't you know

We all have our cross to bear
We all knuckle under sometimes
Oh, everybody gets his share
We all have our cross to bear

Oh, I just got to have my freedom
And if that's giving you the blues
Well, that's the price you pay, Lord, there ain't no other way
But to get down on your knees and pay your dues
'Cause don't you know

We all have our cross to bear
Oh, we all walk in darkness sometimes
Oh, everybody gets his share, mmm
'Cause we all have our cross to bear
