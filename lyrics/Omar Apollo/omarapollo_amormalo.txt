Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Amor Malo"



Got into some bad love
Now my heart's a mess
Got into some bad love
Now my heart's a mess

I see you for a while
I've been wasting love
You don't hear me now
I've been calling up
You think I got it all
I don't have enough
Used to all my lies
Why'd you call?

Wish you could love me
Wish you could love me
And I'm fine

Got into some bad love
Now my heart's a mess
Got into some bad love
Now my heart's a mess

You never did me wrong
I left it in the dust
Two rules for me to trust
I thought you couldn't now
But I just wish you had forever

You never judged me
I wish you could love me
And I'm fine

Got into some bad love
Now my heart's a mess
Got into some bad love
Now my heart's a mess
