Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Today"
(feat. Teo Halm)



Too many days I've felt they were strange
No wonder I feel like it's never gonna change
I just walk by, I'm thinking 'bout another
You don't, you don't even wanna know that
Today is just another day
Make my bed, I'm on my way
Checked my texts now I'm feeling like I'm gonna die
I should've took a five degree
Took some time to brush my teeth
Watched a movie, now I'm feeling like I'm gonna cry
I left my peace in the sheets

I don't know why I'm still here
When I should be asleep
I wish I was asleep
I wish I was asleep

I ain't runnin' from my shit, I'm just stressed out
I ain't far from the light, doing my best now
I'm just really trine swerve in the traffic
Feel the best when I'm lying in the street crack
Pretty far from okay, doing pretty bad
I'm just check up out my car, where my keys at?
Pulling up and the key's in ignition
I just really think I need some attention

I should've took a five degree
Took some time to brush my teeth
Watched a movie, now I'm feeling like I wanna cry
I left my peace in the sheets

I don't know why I'm still here
When I should be asleep
I wish I was asleep
I wish I was asleep
