Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Saving All My Love"



Aggressive how he God, yeah, you turning both ways
Don't you lie to yourself, boy, that's a cold place
See it on your whole face
Don't get attached to your body, it change with old age
I know you feel that cocaine
I see the lies through your nose
Prince Voil√†, I left my body exposed, you left with nada
I'm feeling brava
Sweat drip down my eyes, yeah, but he got that Prada
And the sun don't shine and my headphones died and the tide is low
Watch the wings collapse and you free fall down, that's a dirty road
Turn around, turn around, turn around, everything's in front of you
Happiness can stay a while
But sometimes it don't come alright, no
So I wait, why wait?
Do you chase? Not patient
So I saved all my love for you

Still Woozy - "Habit" I could let you have it
You could be my habit
You could be my woman, right
I don't want you havin'
Anytime I know
You're living in a hole
Anytime I know
I could let you have it
You could be my habit...
ODIE - "Miss Summer" Oh, there she goes, Mrs Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time living in pretend
Till I play my role
She'll be running
On...
Joyce Wrice & KAYTRANADA - "Iced Tea" I just wanna let go
I solo
Speaking on my M.O.
What they don't know
Know you see the skin glow
Sweet like cocoa
Keep up with my tempo
While I let go

Way
Feel some way
When I'm in my bag
Can't slow...
Dominic Fike - "Wurli" Steppin' outside for you (Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Then I put links on both wrists
'Cause you got control over me
And you got jokes like you don't need love, baby
We don't need long...
Bruno Major - "Places We Won't Walk" Sunlight dances off the leaves
Birds of red color the trees
Flowers filled with buzzin' bees
In places we won't walk

Neon lights shine bold and bright
Buildings grow at dizzyin' heights
People come...
