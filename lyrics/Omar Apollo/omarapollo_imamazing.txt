"I'm Amazing"



I'm amazing, that's what they tell me
I don't think of that too much, it overwhelm me
I don't think you love me 'cause you don't reach out
Yeah, you broke my fuckin' heart, took a piece out
Since I was eighteen, I've had my mask off
And I wish you could've seen how much I slacked off
You my baby, you make me inhale
Yeah, these bitches always fillin' up my email
Why you tryna play me? Don't get no detail (Tryna play me)
I'ma hit it from the back and then we reset
And I ain't called you, that's on me, bruh (That's on me)
I've been on the road too much and I ain't seen ya

Don't make me wish I didn't
Don't make me wish I didn't (We still fuck on the side)
Don't make me wish I didn't (And it's just you and I)
Don't make me wish I didn't

Aqui me quedo, me voy temprano
Y que voy a estar tarde, soy Mexicano
When I needed money that I could borrow
Pick you up, then have a show up in Chicago
I'm makin' M's now, listenin' to Stevie
And the whip got autopilot when I'm sleepy
We in the city, you like bikinis
Know I shoulda said somethin', I know, believe me
Moved away, but you got a girl now
Shit remind me when I used to blow your back out
You fuckin' hate me, on different paths now
Yeah, I used to drink so much, but now I tap out

Don't make me wish I didn't
Don't make me wish I didn't (We still fuck on the side)
Don't make me wish I didn't (And it's just you and I)
Don't make me wish I didn't (We still fuck on the side)
Don't make me wish I didn't (And it's just you and I)
Don't make me wish I didn't (And it's just you and I)
Don't make me wish I didn't (And I wish you good times)
We still fuck on the side
And I fucked up my mind
I think of just you and I
I think of just you and I
