Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Highlight"



You are not a stranger
It's been a minute since I felt commitment
The way you touch my body
Feels like there's no parallels around me
I don't wanna leave no more
I just wanna stay involved
My best friend, you're still mine
You see our love don't end
It lasted time, why, why, why

Donde ay mucha gente yo no veo pa' ya
Yo veo el futuro yo no voy patras
Son muchos que me quieren pero no le dan
Les digo que me esperan que ahora tengo mas
Basically just tell me when it's time to go
I been trying to leave for like a hour so
After I seen the tattoo, I knew it was bad bad news

Why why why (Why, why, why)
Why why why (Why, why, why)
Between those legs (Between those legs)
Between those thighs (Between those thighs)
My best friend (My best friend)
You're still mine (You're still mine)
You see our love don't end
It lasted time, why, why, why

You my Highlight
Highlight
You my Highlight
Highlight
