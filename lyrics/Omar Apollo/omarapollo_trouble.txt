Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Trouble"



Costly, I tell you
You need to grow
Feels close to heaven
Past the unknown

I'm still thinkin' bout you
Too-da-loo
It's bloody oh I
([?] only trouble
[?] only trouble) I...
You're goin' far
(Only trouble, only trouble
Only trouble)

It's just nice to meet you anyway
Didn't mean to scare you yesterday
Thought you wanted all that I could bring

Kiss me one time
I've been dyin' to know
If this is real life
Then I'm down with growin' old

I'm still thinkin' bout you
([?] only trouble
[?] only trouble)
Too-da-loo
(Only trouble, only trouble)

It's just nice to meet you anyway
Didn't mean to scare you yesterday
Thought you wanted all that I could bring

I need to wait
Good at rushing
Love on my mind
Days that I, I hope I find

Why you runnin', why you run away
Why you runnin', why you run away
Why you runnin', why you run away

Why you runnin', why you run away
Why you runnin', why you run away
Why you runnin', why you run away

Why you runnin', why you run away
Why you runnin', why you run away
Why you runnin', why you run away
