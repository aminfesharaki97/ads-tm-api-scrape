"Talk" lyrics

Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Talk"



Bite your tongue, bite your tongue on purpose
Said you really need to see me in person
"I'm on my way!" yeah, you make it sound urgent
When I see you feel like I be done searching
Serious, seriously broken
Yeah, I really need to see you, not joking
But I really need some time to be open
I don't really mean the words that I've spoken

I really like you in the morning
This feeling's got me talking
Too much
And I'll be here till Sunday
I'll see you again someday

Ay, ay
I gotta fix it, when we all alone all I wanna do is kiss it
When I'm getting home, I don't know but I can text you
When I'm in the street, look good, take a picture
Take a picture, take a picture, take a picture
Do you miss me?
Say you gotta work today, boy, go and get ya money
Pay me up to separate us if you feelin' lucky
Bottle up my feelings so much, one day you won't love me
One day you might love me

He got questions
I can answer them all night long
Catch a flight, now I gotta go
I just never wanna be alone
Doing good on my own
If you know then I gotta know
Make me fall like a domino

I really like you in the morning
This feeling's got me talking
Too much
And I'll be here till Sunday
I'll see you again someday

I really like you in the morning
This feeling's got me talking
Too much
And I'll be here till Sunday
I'll see you again someday

So I've
Been in the...

Then I got to know you, oh false hopes rule
And then I opened, right up to you
