"Go Away" lyrics

Omar Apollo Lyrics




"Go Away"



You can take the throne
Body glows like gold
Beating hearts lie close
Without you, time moves slow

Do you think that I could stay?
'Cause if I leave, then I complain
I know this feeling's not a crime
You said you feel it all the time

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

If you saw me every morning
Would you feel less important?
Is that too much I'm forcing?
'Cause I don't wanna be much
I love the way that we touch
Do you like all of my friends, and
I want your attention
Before you'd never mention
That you got time here to stay
Is that too much for your brain?

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
