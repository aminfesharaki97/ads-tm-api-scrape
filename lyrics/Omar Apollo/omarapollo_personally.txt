"Personally"



'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score

Remember when you told me
That I ain't lonely you used to hold me
You always was the one to make up reasons quick
And I would be the one that would believe in it
Facetime me just to pass time
But I still rewind what you said last night
You said that you would always have some reasoning
How come you only did that on the weekend, then?

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
And all it ever did was change the person in me

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
All it ever did was change the person in me

'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score

Can't sleep 'cause I been stressed out
My eyes they caved in, I scarred my eyebrow
Too much that's on my mind, I gotta deal with shit
It'll slow me down if I don't come to peace with it
Relax, you told me relax
But I can't focus if I don't fight back
When you said I love you, you was joking then
Ain't seen you in years but we ain't spoken since

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
And all it ever did was change the person in me

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
All it ever did was change the person in me

'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score
